List of suggestions and ideas for CmdLine/cmdparse:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What about letting the user define an "ArgCatcher" handler of sorts to
  "handle" bad/unknown arguments (we have to tell them the bad argument
  and the reason it was bad - in addition to the usual stuff). What would
  this function return?

- Perhaps each CmdArg<Type> that is a not abstract should have 2 versions
  of each constructor: one that takes an initial value and one that doesnt.

- Perhaps a CmdLine should have facilities to get/set the long & short
  option prefixes (and the end-options string too).

- Maybe I need a more abstract class that is a parent of CmdLine. Perhaps
  some of the stuff in CmdLine could be transferred to this class. I would
  need to make some private stuff protected though - do I really want that?

- What about a CmdArgAlias class that mereley adds another interface on top
  of an existing CmdArg? Only problem is, would you want them to share
  flags (not syntax flags but the specification flags)??? Dont know how
  I would do this if you did!
