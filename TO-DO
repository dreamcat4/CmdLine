List of things still to do for CmdLine/cmdparse:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Get cmdparse(1) to work with the 'es' shell.

- Implement vms_style parsing
  For this - I will need to add a "last_list_matched" to the cmdline-object
  to handle stuff like "(a,b/c,d)".  Also, what am I going to do about
  looking at the original command-line (with lib$get_foreign)? I dont 
  think it is reasonable to always compare the argv[] of a CmdArgvIter
  to the command-line. Perhaps VMS should have a parse(void) member function
  of a CmdLine that does nothing for Unix (or perhaps uses <execargs.h>).

- Implement ibm_style parsing
